dimension.py:
Calculates the code dimension for four different cases of three-dimensional quantum codes (Case A, B, C, D). The code dimension is a fundamental property that characterizes the number of logical qubits encoded by the quantum error-correcting code.
plot_4_cases.py:
Generates scatter plots comparing code distances and code dimensions for four types of quantum codes when the total number of qubits is 144 and 432.
check_logical.py:
Specifically designed for Case C, this script verifies whether some operators of length 4 and 5 are logical operators for the quantum code.
